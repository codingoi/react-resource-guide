## Import React
Wooo! Your first React component!

In the last exercise, we started by importing from react. The line that did this is:

```
import React from 'react';
```
This creates an object named React which contains methods necessary to use the React library.

You’ve already seen one of the methods contained in the React library: React.createElement(). Recall that when a JSX element is compiled, it transforms into a React.createElement() call.

For this reason, you have to import the React library, and save it in a variable named React, before you can use any JSX at all. React.createElement() must be available in order for JSX to work.

## Import ReactDOM
In order to create our first component, we next imported the ReactDOM:

```
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```
This line of code is very similar to line 1.

Both import JavaScript objects. In both lines, the imported object contains React-related methods.

However, there is a difference!

The methods imported from 'react-dom' are meant for interacting with the DOM. You are already familiar with one of them: ReactDOM.render().

The methods imported from 'react' don’t deal with the DOM at all. They don’t engage directly with anything that isn’t part of React.

To clarify: the DOM is used in React applications, but it isn’t part of React. After all, the DOM is also used in countless non-React applications. Methods imported from 'react' are only for pure React purposes, such as creating components or writing JSX elements.


## Create a Component Class
You’ve learned that a React component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job, which often involves rendering HTML.

Here’s another fact about components: we can use a JavaScript class to define a new React component. We can also define components with JavaScript functions, but we’ll focus on class components first.

All class components will have some methods and properties in common (more on this later). Rather than rewriting those same properties over and over again every time, we extend the Component class from the React library. This way, we can use code that we import from the React library, without having to write it over and over again ourselves.

After we define our class component, we can use it to render as many instances of that component as we want.

What is React.Component, and how do you use it to make a component class?

React.Component is a JavaScript class. To create your own component class, you must subclass React.Component. You can do this by using the syntax class YourComponentNameGoesHere extends React.Component {}.

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
 
class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
 
ReactDOM.render(
    <MyComponentClass />, 
    document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Name a Component Class

Component class variable names must begin with capital letters!

## Component Class Instructions
- On line 1, import React from 'react' creates a JavaScript object. This object contains properties that are needed to make React work, such as React.createElement() and React.Component.

- On line 2, import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' creates another JavaScript object. This object contains methods that help React interact with the DOM, such as ReactDOM.render().

- On line 4, by subclassing React.Component, you create a new component class. This is not a component! A component class is more like a factory that produces components. When you start making components, each one will come from a component class.

- Whenever you create a component class, you need to give that component class a name. That name should be written in UpperCamelCase. In this case, your chosen name is MyComponentClass.


## The Render Function
A component class is like a factory that builds components. It builds these components by consulting a set of instructions, which you must provide. Let’s talk about these instructions!

For starters, these instructions should take the form of a class declaration body. That means that they will be delimited by curly braces, like this:

```
class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  // instructions go here, between the curly braces
}
```

The instructions should be written in typical JavaScript

There is only one property that you have to include in your instructions: a render method.

A render method is a property whose name is render, and whose value is a function. The term “render method” can refer to the entire property, or to just the function part.

```
class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {}
}
```
A render method must contain a return statement. Usually, this return statement returns a JSX expression:

```
class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Create a Component Instance
MyComponentClass is now a working component class! It’s ready to follow its instructions and make some React components.

So, let’s make a React component! It only takes one more line:

```
<MyComponentClass />
```

To make a React component, you write a JSX element. Instead of naming your JSX element something like h1 or div like you’ve done before, give it the same name as a component class. Voilà, there’s your component instance!

JSX elements can be either HTML-like, or component instances. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two! That is the React-specific reason why component class names must begin with capital letters.

## Render A Component

When you make a new component class, these instructions are the body of your class declaration:

```
class MyComponentClass extends React.Component
{ // everything in between these curly-braces is instructions for how to build components
 
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

This class declaration results in a new component class, in this case named MyComponentClass. MyComponentClass has one method, named render. This all happens via standard JavaScript class syntax.

Whenever you make a component, that component inherits all of the methods of its component class. MyComponentClass has one method: MyComponentClass.render(). Therefore, <MyComponentClass /> also has a method named render.

You could make a million different <MyComponentClass /> instances, and each one would inherit this same exact render method.

``
ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```
ReactDOM.render() will tell <MyComponentClass /> to call its render method.

<MyComponentClass /> will call its render method, which will return the JSX element 
```
<h1>Hello world</h1>.
```
ReactDOM.render() will then take that resulting JSX element, and add it to the virtual DOM. This will make “Hello world” appear on the screen.
