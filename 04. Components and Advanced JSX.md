## Use Multiline JSX in a Component
A multi-line JSX expression should always be wrapped in parentheses!

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class QuoteMaker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The world is full of objects, more or less interesting; I do not wish to add any more.
        </p>
        <cite>
          <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Huebler">
            Douglas Huebler
          </a>
        </cite>
      </blockquote>
    );
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <QuoteMaker />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Use a Variable Attribute in a Component

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const redPanda = {
  src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Endangered_Red_Panda.jpg',
  alt: 'Red Panda',
  width:  '200px'
};

class RedPanda extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Red Panda</h1>
        <img 
          src={redPanda.src}
          alt={redPanda.alt}
          width={redPanda.width} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <RedPanda />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Put Logic in a Render Function

A render() function must have a return statement. However, that isn’t all that it can have.

A render() function can also be a fine place to put simple calculations that need to happen right before a component renders. Here’s an example of some calculations inside of a render function:

```
class Random extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // First, some logic that must happen
    // before rendering:
    const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
    // Next, a return statement
    // using that logic:
    return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
  }
}
```
***Watch out for this common mistake:***

```
class Random extends React.Component {
  // This should be in the render function:
  const n = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
 
  render() {
    return <h1>The number is {n}!</h1>;
  }
};
```
In the above example, the line with the const n declaration will cause a syntax error, as is it should not be part of the class declaration itself, but should occur in a method like render().

## Use a Conditional in a Render Function

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class TodaysPlan extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let task;
    if (!apocalypse) {
      task = 'learn React.js'
    } else {
      task = 'run around'
    }

    return <h1>Today I am going to {task}!</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
	<TodaysPlan />,
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Use this in a Component

The word this gets used in React a lot!

You are especially likely to see this inside of the body of a component class declaration. Here’s an example:

```
class IceCreamGuy extends React.Component {
  get food() {
    return 'ice cream';
  }
 
  render() {
    return <h1>I like {this.food}.</h1>;
  }
}
```

The simple answer is that this refers to an instance of IceCreamGuy. The less simple answer is that this refers to the object on which this‘s enclosing method, in this case .render(), is called. It is almost inevitable that this object will be an instance of IceCreamGuy, but technically it could be something else.

IceCreamGuy has two methods: .food and .render(). Since this will evaluate to an instance of IceCreamGuy, this.food will evaluate to a call of IceCreamGuy‘s .food method. This method will, in turn, evaluate to the string “ice cream.”

You don’t need those parentheses because .food is a getter method. You can tell this from the get in the above class declaration body.


## Use an Event Listener in a Component

Render functions often contain event listeners. Here’s an example of an event listener in a render function:

render() {
  return (
    <div onHover={myFunc}>
    </div>
  );
}
Recall that an event handler is a function that gets called in response to an event. In the above example, the event handler is myFunc().

In React, you define event handlers as methods on a component class. Like this:

``
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  myFunc() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }
 
  render() {
    return (
      <div onHover={this.myFunc}>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
