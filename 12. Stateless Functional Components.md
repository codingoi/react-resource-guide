## Stateless Functional Components

The first Example component is defined as a JavaScript class, but it doesn’t have to be! In React, we can also define components as JavaScript functions — we call them function components to differentiate them from class components.

In the latest versions of React, function components can do everything that class components can do. In most cases, however, function components offer a more elegant, concise way of creating React components.

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

export const Friend = () => {
 
    return <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-octopus.jpg" />;
  
};

ReactDOM.render(
	<Friend />,
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Function Components and Props

Like any component, function components can receive information via props.

To access these props, give your function component a parameter named props. Within the function body, you can access the props using this pattern: props.propertyName. You don’t need to use the this keyword.

```
export function YesNoQuestion (props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{props.prompt}</p>
      <input value="Yes" />
      <input value="No" />
    </div>
  );
}
 
ReactDOM.render(
  <YesNoQuestion prompt="Have you eaten an apple today?" />,
  document.getElementById('app');
);
```
