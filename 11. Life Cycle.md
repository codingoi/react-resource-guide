## The Component Lifecycle

We’ve seen that React components can be highly dynamic. 
They get created, rendered, added to the DOM, updated, and removed. 
All of these steps are part of a component’s lifecycle.

The component lifecycle has three high-level parts:

- Mounting, when the component is being initialized and put into the DOM for the first time
- Updating, when the component updates as a result of changed state or changed props
- Unmounting, when the component is being removed from the DOM

Every React component you’ve ever interacted with does the first step at a minimum. If a component never mounted, you’d never see it!

Most interesting components are updated at some point. A purely static component—like, for example, a logo—might not ever update. But if a component’s state changes, it updates. Or if different props are passed to a component, it updates.

Finally, a component is unmounted when it’s removed from the DOM. For example, if you have a button that hides a component, chances are that component will be unmounted. If your app has multiple screens, it’s likely that each screen (and all of its child components) will be unmounted. If a component is “alive” for the entire lifetime of your app (say, a top-level <App /> component or a persistent navigation bar), it won’t be unmounted. But most components can get unmounted one way or another!

It’s worth noting that each component instance has its own lifecycle. For example, if you have 3 buttons on a page, then there are 3 component instances, each with its own lifecycle. However, once a component instance is unmounted, that’s it—it will never be re-mounted, or updated again, or unmounted.

constructor() is the first method called during the mounting phase. render() is called later during the mounting phase, to render the component for the first time, and during the updating phase, to re-render the component.

Notice that lifecycle methods don’t necessarily correspond one-to-one with part of the lifecycle. constructor() only executes during the mounting phase, but render() executes during both the mounting and updating phase.

## componentDidMount

componentDidMount() is the final method called during the mounting phase. The order is:

- The constructor
- render()
- componentDidMount()


## componentWillUnmount

When the component is unmounted - it is in other words, removed from the page

componentWillUnmount() is called in the unmounting phase, right before the component is completely destroyed. It’s a useful time to clean up any of your component’s mess.

## componentDidUpdate

An update is caused by changes to props or state. You’ve already seen this happen a bunch of times. Every time you’ve called setState() with new data, you’ve triggered an update. Every time you change the props passed to a component, you’ve caused it to update.

When a component updates, it calls several methods, but only two are commonly used.

The first is render(), which we’ve seen in every React component. When a component’s props or state changes, render() is called.

The second, which we haven’t seen yet, is componentDidUpdate(). 

componentDidUpdate(). It should take one argument, prevProps, which will be the props this component had the last time it was rendered. We’ll fill it in next.
