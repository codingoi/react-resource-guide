## this.props

In this lesson, you will learn another way that components can interact: a component can pass information to another component.

Information that gets passed from one component to another is known as “props.”

props is the name of the object that stores passed-in information. this.props refers to that storage object. At the same time, each piece of passed-in information is called a prop. This means that props could refer to two pieces of passed-in information, or it could refer to the object that stores those pieces of information

## Access a Component's props

Every component has something called props.

A component’s props is an object. It holds information about that component.

To see a component’s props object, you use the expression this.props. Here’s an example of this.props being used inside of a render method:

```
render() {
  console.log("Props object comin' up!");
 
  console.log(this.props);
 
  console.log("That was my props object!");
 
  return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
}
```

## Pass `props` to a Component

You can pass information to a React component.

How? By giving that component an attribute:

```
<MyComponent foo="bar" />
```
Let’s say that you want to pass a component the message, "This is some top secret info.". Here’s how you could do it:

```
<Example message="This is some top secret info." />
```
As you can see, to pass information to a component, you need a name for the information that you want to pass.

In the above example, we used the name message. You can use any name you want.

If you want to pass information that isn’t a string, then wrap that information in curly braces. Here’s how you would pass an array:

```
<Greeting myInfo={["top", "secret", "lol"]} />
```

In this next example, we pass several pieces of information to <Greeting />. The values that aren’t strings are wrapped in curly braces:

```
<Greeting name="Frarthur" town="Fl undon" age={2} haunted={false} />
```

## Render a Component's props
Here’s how to make a component display passed-in information:

- Find the component class that is going to receive that information.
- Include this.props.name-of-information in that component class’s render method’s return statement.


```
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hi there, {this.props.firstName}</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Greeting firstName='roberta' />, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Pass props From Component To Component

The most common use of props is to pass information to a component, from a different component. You haven’t done that yet, but it’s very similar to what you’ve seen already.

## Put an Event Handler in a Component Class
You can, and often will, pass functions as props. It is especially common to pass event handler functions.

In the next lesson, you will pass an event handler function as a prop. However, you have to define an event handler before you can pass one anywhere. In this lesson, you will define an event handler function.

You define an event handler as a method on the component class, just like the render method.

```
 handleEvent() {
    alert(`I am an event handler.
      If you see this message,
      then I have been called.`);
  }
  ```
  
  ## Pass an Event Handler as a prop
  
  ```
  class Talker extends React.Component {
  talk() {
    let speech = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      speech += 'blah ';
    }
    alert(speech);
  }
  
  render() {
    return <Button talk={this.talk}/>;
  }
}
```

### Receive an Event Handler as a prop

Talker (above) is being rendered. Talker is built using the Button component. 
Talker passes its method to button through props, and Button initializes the method with it's onClick event handler. 

```
import React from 'react';

export class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.props.talk}>
        Click me!
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```
## handleEvent, onEvent, and this.props.onEvent

Let’s talk about naming things.

When you pass an event handler as a prop, as you just did, there are two names that you have to choose.

Both naming choices occur in the parent component class - that is, in the component class that defines the event handler and passes it.

Here’s how the naming convention works: first, think about what type of event you are listening for. In our example, the event type was “click.”

If you are listening for a “click” event, then you name your event handler handleClick. If you are listening for a “keyPress” event, then you name your event handler handleKeyPress:

```
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  handleHover() {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will be called in response to "hover" events.');
  }
}
```
Your prop name should be the word on, plus your event type. If you are listening for a “click” event, then you name your prop onClick. If you are listening for a “keyPress” event, then you name your prop onKeyPress:
```
class MyClass extends React.Component {
  handleHover() {
    alert('I am an event handler.');
    alert('I will listen for a "hover" event.');
  }
 
  render() {
    return <Child onHover={this.handleHover} />;
  }
}
```

One major source of confusion is the fact that names like onClick have special meaning, but only if they’re used on HTML-like elements.

Look at Button.js. When you give a <button></button> an attribute named onClick, then the name onClick has special meaning. As you’ve learned, this special onClick attribute creates an event listener, listening for clicks on the <button></button>:

```
// Button.js
 
// The attribute name onClick
// creates an event listner:
<button onClick={this.props.onClick}>
  Click me!
</button>
```

Now look at Talker.js. Here, when you give <Button /> an attribute named onClick, then the name onClick doesn’t do anything special. The name onClick does not create an event listener when used on <Button /> - it’s just an arbitrary attribute name:

```
// Talker.js
 
// The attribute name onClick
// is just a normal attribute name:
<Button onClick={this.handleClick} />
```

The reason for this is that <Button /> is not an HTML-like JSX element; it’s a component instance.

Names like onClick only create event listeners if they’re used on HTML-like JSX elements. Otherwise, they’re just ordinary prop names.

## this.props.children

Every component’s props object has a property named children.

this.props.children will return everything in between a component’s opening and closing JSX tags.

So far, all of the components that you’ve seen have been self-closing tags, such as ```<MyComponentClass />```. They don’t have to be! You could write ```<MyComponentClass></MyComponentClass>```, and it would still work.

this.props.children would return everything in between ```<MyComponentClass>``` and ```</MyComponentClass>```.

 In Example 1, ```<BigButton>```‘s this.props.children would equal the text, “I am a child of BigButton.”

```
<BigButton>
  I am a child of BigButton.
</BigButton>
```

In Example 2, this.props.children would equal a <LilButton /> component.

```
// Example 2
<BigButton>
  <LilButton />
</BigButton>
```

In Example 3, this.props.children would equal undefined.

```
// Example 3
<BigButton />
```
If a component has more than one child between its JSX tags, then this.props.children will return those children in an array. However, if a component has only one child, then this.props.children will return the single child, not wrapped in an array.


## defaultProps

Button expects to receive a prop named text. The received text will be displayed inside of a <button></button> element.

What if nobody passes any text to Button?

If nobody passes any text to Button, then Button‘s display will be blank. It would be better if Button could display a default message instead.

You can make this happen by giving your component class a property named defaultProps:

```
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
}
```

Example.defaultProps;
The defaultProps property should be equal to an object:

```
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
}
 
// Set defaultProps equal to an object:
Example.defaultProps = {};
```

Inside of this object, write properties for any default props that you’d like to set:

```
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.text}</h1>;
  }
}
 
Example.defaultProps = { text: 'yo' };
```
