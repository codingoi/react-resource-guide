## One Sibling to Display, Another to Change

One of the very first things that you learned about components is that they should only have one job.

In the last lesson, Child had two jobs:

- Child displayed a name.
- Child offered a way to change that name.

You should divide Child in two: one component for displaying the name, and a different component for allowing a user to change the name.

***That brings us to the essential new concept for this lesson: you will have one stateless component display information, and a different stateless component offer the ability to change that information.***

## Pass the Right props to the Right Siblings

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Child } from './Child';
import { Sibling } from './Sibling';

class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { name: 'Frarthur' };

    this.changeName = this.changeName.bind(this);
  }

  changeName(newName) {
    this.setState({
      name: newName
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Child 
          onChange={this.changeName} />
        <Sibling name={this.state.name} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Parent />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

```
import React from 'react';

export class Sibling extends React.Component {
  render() {
		const name = this.props.name
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hey, my name is {name}!</h1>
        <h2>Don't you think {name} is the prettiest name ever?</h2>
        <h2>Sure am glad that my parents picked {name}!</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
## Stateless Components Inherit From Stateful Components Recap

A stateful component class defines a function that calls this.setState. (Parent)

The stateful component passes that function down to a stateless component. (Parent)

That stateless component class defines a function that calls the passed-down function, and that can take an event object as an argument. (Child)

The stateless component class uses this new function as an event handler. (Child)

When an event is detected, the parentâ€™s state updates. (A user selects a new dropdown menu item)

The stateful component class passes down its state, distinct from the ability to change its state, to a different stateless component. (Parent)

That stateless component class receives the state and displays it. (Sibling.js)

An instance of the stateful component class is rendered. One stateless child component displays the state, and a different stateless child component (sibling) displays a way to change the state. (Parent.js, lines 23-26)
