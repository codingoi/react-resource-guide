## Hooks Intro

As React developers, we love breaking down complex problems into simple pieces.

Classes, however, are not simple. They:

- are difficult to reuse between components
- are tricky and time-consuming to test
- have confused many developers and caused lots of bugs

The React core team heard all of this feedback from developers like us, and they engineered an incredible solution for us! React 16.8+ supports Hooks. With Hooks, we can use simple function components to do lots of the fancy things that we could only do with class components in the past.

React Hooks, plainly put, are functions that let us manage the internal state of components and handle post-rendering side effects directly from our function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let us use fancy React features without classes. Keep in mind that function components and React Hooks do not replace class components. They are completely optional; just a new tool that we can take advantage of.

React offers a number of built-in Hooks. A few of these include 
- useState(), 
- useEffect(), 
- useContext(), 
- useReducer(), 
- and useRef().

## Update Function Component State

Let’s get started with the State Hook, the most common Hook used for building React components. The State Hook is a named export from the React library, so we import it like this:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```
useState() is a JavaScript function defined in the React library. When we call this function, it returns an array with two values:

current state - the current value of this state
state setter - a function that we can use to update the value of this state
Because React returns these two values in an array, we can assign them to local variables, naming them whatever we like. For example:

```
const [toggle, setToggle] = useState();
```
Let’s have a look at an example of a function component using the State Hook:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
 
function Toggle() {
  const [toggle, setToggle] = useState();
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The toggle is {toggle}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setToggle("On")}>On</button>
      <button onClick={() => setToggle("Off")}>Off</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how the state setter function, setToggle(), is called by our onClick event listeners. To update the value of toggle and re-render this component with the new value, all we need to do is call the setToggle() function with the next state value as an argument.

No need to worry about binding functions to class instances, working with constructors, or dealing with the this keyword. With the State Hook, updating state is as simple as calling a state setter function.

Calling the state setter signals to React that the component needs to re-render, so the whole function defining the component is called again. The magic of useState() is that it allows React to keep track of the current value of state from one render to the next!

```
// import the default export and the named export `useState` from the 'react' library
import React, {useState} from 'react';
export default function ColorPicker() {
  // call useState and assign its return values to `color` and `setColor`
  const [color, setColor] = useState();

 const divStyle = {backgroundColor: color};

  return (
    <div style={divStyle}>
      <p>The color is {color}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setColor("Aquamarine")}>
        Aquamarine
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor("BlueViolet")}>
        BlueViolet
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor("Chartreuse")}>
        Chartreuse
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => setColor("CornflowerBlue")}>
        CornflowerBlue
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Initialize State

To initialize our state with any value we want, we simply pass the initial value as an argument to the useState() function call.

```
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
```
or

```
export default function ColorPicker() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("Tomato");
```

- During the first render, the initial state argument is used.
- When the state setter is called, React ignores the initial state argument and uses the new value.
- When the component re-renders for any other reason, React continues to use the same value from the previous render

If we don’t pass an initial value when calling useState(), then the current value of the state during the first render will be undefined. Often, this is perfectly fine for the machines, but it can be unclear to the humans reading our code. So, we prefer to explicitly initialize our state. If we don’t have the value needed during the first render, we can explicitly pass null instead of just passively leaving the value as undefined.


## Use State Setter Outside of JSX

Let’s see how to manage the changing value of a string as a user types into a text input field:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
export default function EmailTextInput() {
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const updatedEmail = event.target.value;
    setEmail(updatedEmail);
  }
 
  return (
    <input value={email} onChange={handleChange} />
  );
}
```
Let’s break down how this code works!

- The square brackets on the left side of the assignment operator signal array destructuring
- The local variable named email is assigned the current state value at index 0 from the array returned by useState()
- The local variable named setEmail() is assigned a reference to the state setter function at index 1 from the array returned by useState()
- It’s convention to name this variable using the current state variable (email) with “set” prepended
- The JSX input tag has an event listener called onChange. This event listener calls an event handler each time the user types something in this element. In the example above, our event handler is defined inside of the definition for our function component, but outside of our JSX. Earlier in this lesson, we wrote our event handlers right in our JSX. Those inline event handlers work perfectly fine, but when we want to do something more interesting than just calling the state setter with a static value, it’s a good idea to separate that logic from everything else going on in our JSX. This separation of concerns makes our code easier to read, test, and modify.

This is so common in React code, that we can comfortably simplify this:

const handleChange = (event) => {
  const newEmail = event.target.value;
  setEmail(newEmail);
}

To this:

```
const handleChange = (event) => setEmail(event.target.value);
```
Or even, use object destructuring to just write this:

```
const handleChange = ({target}) => setEmail(target.value);
```
All three of these code snippets behave the same way, so there really isn’t a right and wrong between these different ways of doing this. We’ll use the last, most concise version moving forward.

Example: 

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

// regex to match numbers between 1 and 10 digits long
const validPhoneNumber = /^\d{1,10}$/;

export default function PhoneNumber() {
  const [phone, setPhone] = useState('');
  
   const handleChange = ({ target })=> {
     const newPhone = target.value;
     const isValid = validPhoneNumber.test(newPhone);
     if (isValid) {
       setPhone(newPhone);
     }
     // just ignore the event, when new value is invalid
    };

  return (
    <div className='phone'>
      <label for='phone-input'>Phone: </label>
      <input value={phone} onChange={handleChange} id='phone-input' />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Set From Previous State

Often, the next value of our state is calculated using the current state. In this case, it is best practice to update state with a callback function. If we do not, we risk capturing outdated, or “stale”, state values.

Let’s take a look at the following code:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 
  const increment = () => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Wow, you've clicked that button: {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click here!</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
When the button is pressed, the increment() event handler is called. Inside of this function, we use our setCount() state setter in a new way! Because the next value of count depends on the previous value of count, we pass a callback function as the argument for setCount() instead of a value (as we’ve done in previous exercises).

setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)
When our state setter calls the callback function, this state setter callback function takes our previous count as an argument. The value returned by this state setter callback function is used as the next value of count (in this case prevCount + 1).

Example

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function QuizNavBar({ questions }) {
  const [questionIndex, setQuestionIndex] = useState(0);

  const goBack = () =>
    setQuestionIndex((prevQuestionIndex) => prevQuestionIndex - 1);
  const goToNext = () =>
    setQuestionIndex((prevQuestionIndex) => prevQuestionIndex + 1);

  const onFirstQuestion = questionIndex === 0;
  const onLastQuestion = questionIndex === questions.length - 1;

  return (
    <nav>
      <span>Question #{questionIndex + 1}</span>
      <div>
        <button onClick={goBack} disabled={onFirstQuestion}>
          Go Back
        </button>
        <button onClick={goToNext} disabled={onLastQuestion}>
          Next Question
        </button>
      </div>
    </nav>
  );
}
```
## Arrays in State

When updating an array in state, we do not just add new data to the previous array. We replace the previous array with a brand new array. This means that any information that we want to save from the previous array needs to be explicitly copied over to our new array. That’s what this spread syntax does for us: ...prev.

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ItemList from "./ItemList";
import { produce, pantryItems } from "./storeItems";

export default function GroceryCart() {
  const [cart, setCart] = useState([]);

  const addItem = (item) => {
    setCart((prev) => {
      return [item, ...prev];
    });
  };

  const removeItem = (targetIndex) => {
    setCart((prev) => {
      return prev.filter((item, index) => index !== targetIndex);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Grocery Cart</h1>
      <ul>
        {cart.map((item, index) => (
          <li onClick={() => removeItem(index)} key={index}>
            {item}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <h2>Produce</h2>
      <ItemList items={produce} onItemClick={addItem} />
      <h2>Pantry Items</h2>
      <ItemList items={pantryItems} onItemClick={addItem} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Objects in State

When we work with a set of related variables, it can be very helpful to group them in an object. Let’s look at an example!

```
export default function Login() {
  const [formState, setFormState] = useState({});
 
  const handleChange = ({ target }) => {
    const { name, value } = target;
    setFormState((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [name]: value
    }));
  };
 
  return (
    <form>
      <input
        value={formState.firstName}
        onChange={handleChange}
        name="firstName"
        type="text"
      />
      <input
        value={formState.password}
        onChange={handleChange}
        type="password"
        name="password"
      />
    </form>
  );
}
```
A few things to notice:

We use a state setter callback function to update state based on the previous value
The spread syntax is the same for objects as for arrays: { ...oldObject, newKey: newValue }
We reuse our event handler across multiple inputs by using the input tag’s name attribute to identify which input the change event came from
Once again, when updating the state with setFormState() inside a function component, we do not modify the same object. We must copy over the values from the previous object when setting the next value of state. Thankfully, the spread syntax makes this super easy to do!

Anytime one of the input values is updated, the handleChange() function will be called. Inside of this event handler, we use object destructuring to unpack the target property from our event object, then we use object destructuring again to unpack the name and value properties from the target object.

Inside of our state setter callback function, we wrap our curly brackets in parentheses like so: setFormState((prev) => ({ ...prev })). This tells JavaScript that our curly brackets refer to a new object to be returned. We use ..., the spread operator, to fill in the corresponding fields from our previous state. Finally, we overwrite the appropriate key with its updated value. Did you notice the square brackets around the name? This Computed Property Name allows us to use the string value stored by the name variable as a property key!

```
import React, { useState } from "react";

export default function EditProfile() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState({});

  const handleChange = ({ target }) => {
    const {name, value} = target;
    setProfile((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [name]: value
    }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(JSON.stringify(profile, '', 2));
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        value={profile.firstName || ''}
        name="firstName"
        type="text"
        placeholder="First Name"
        onChange = {handleChange}
      />
      <input
        value={profile.lastName || ''}
        type="text"
        name="lastName"
        placeholder="Last Name"
        onChange = {handleChange}
      />
      <input
        value={profile.bday || ''}
        type="date"
        name="bday"
        onChange = {handleChange}
      />
      <input
        value={profile.password || ''}
        type="password"
        name="password"
        placeholder="Password"
        onChange = {handleChange}
      />
      <button 
      type="submit"
      
      >Submit</button>
    </form>
    
  );
}
```

## Separate Hooks for Separate States

While there are times when it can be helpful to store related data in a data collection like an array or object, it can also be helpful to separate data that changes separately into completely different state variables. Managing dynamic data is much easier when we keep our data models as simple as possible.

For example, if we had a single object that held state for a subject you are studying at school, it might look something like this:

```
function Subject() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    currentGrade: 'B',
    classmates: ['Hasan', 'Sam', 'Emma'],
    classDetails: {topic: 'Math', teacher: 'Ms. Barry', room: 201};
    exams: [{unit: 1, score: 91}, {unit: 2, score: 88}]);
  });
  ```
  
This would work, but think about how messy it could get to copy over all the other values when we need to update something in this big state object. For example, to update the grade on an exam, we would need an event handler that did something like this:

```
setState((prev) => ({
 ...prev,
  exams: prev.exams.map((exam) => {
    if( exam.unit === updatedExam.unit ){
      return { 
        ...exam,
        score: updatedExam.score
      };
    } else {
      return exam;
    }
  }),
}));
```
Yikes! Complex code like this is likely to cause bugs! Luckily, there is another option… We can make more than one call to the State Hook. In fact, we can make as many calls to useState() as we want! It’s best to split state into multiple state variables based on which values tend to change together. We can rewrite the previous example as follows…
```
function Subject() {
  const [currentGrade, setGrade] = useState('B');
  const [classmates, setClassmates] = useState(['Hasan', 'Sam', 'Emma']);
  const [classDetails, setClassDetails] = useState({topic: 'Math', teacher: 'Ms. Barry', room: 201});
  const [exams, setExams] = useState([{unit: 1, score: 91}, {unit: 2, score: 88}]);
  // ...
}

```

Managing dynamic data with separate state variables has many advantages, like making our code more simple to write, read, test, and reuse across components.

```
function MusicalRefactored() {
// write your code here
const [title, setTitle] = useState("Best Musical Ever");
const [actors, setActors] = useState(["George Wilson", "Tim Hughes", "Larry Clements"]);
const [locations, setLocations] = useState({
      Chicago: {
        dates: ["1/1", "2/2"], 
        address: "chicago theater"}, 
      SanFrancisco: {
        dates: ["5/2"], 
        address: "sf theater"
      }
    })
}
```
