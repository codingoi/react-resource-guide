## Pass a Component's State
A ```<Parent />``` is supposed to pass its state to a ```<Child />```.

## Don't Update props

**A component should never update this.props. **

```
class Bad extends React.Component {
  render() {
    this.props.message = 'yo'; // NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>;
  }
}
```

This is potentially confusing. props and state store dynamic information. Dynamic information can change, by definition. If a component canâ€™t change its props, then what are props for?

A React component should use props to store information that can be changed, but can only be changed by a different component.

A React component should use state to store information that the component itself can change.
