## propTypes

propTypes are useful for two reasons. 

The first reason is prop validation.

Validation can ensure that your props are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. If props are missing, or if they’re present but they aren’t what you’re expecting, then a warning will print in the console.

This is useful, but reason #2 is arguably more useful: documentation.

Documenting props makes it easier to glance at a file and quickly understand the component class inside. When you have a lot of files, and you will, this can be a huge benefit.

## Apply PropTypes

If a component class expects a prop, then you can use propTypes for that component class!

In order to start using propTypes, we need to import the 'prop-types' library.

```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```
Then, you can declare propTypes as a static property for your component after the component has been defined. 

```
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

export class MessageDisplayer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.message}</h1>;
  }
}

// This propTypes object should have
// one property for each expected prop:
MessageDisplayer.propTypes = {
  message: PropTypes.string
};
```
