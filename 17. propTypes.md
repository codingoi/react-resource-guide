## propTypes

propTypes are useful for two reasons. 

The first reason is prop validation.

Validation can ensure that your props are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. If props are missing, or if they’re present but they aren’t what you’re expecting, then a warning will print in the console.

This is useful, but reason #2 is arguably more useful: documentation.

Documenting props makes it easier to glance at a file and quickly understand the component class inside. When you have a lot of files, and you will, this can be a huge benefit.
