## Function Component Effects

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 
function PageTitle() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
 
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Hi, ${name}`;
  });
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Use the input field below to rename this page!</p>
      <input onChange={({target}) => setName(target.value)} value={name} type='text' />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The first argument passed to the useEffect() function is the callback function that we want React to call after each time this component renders. We will refer to this callback function as our effect.

In our example, the effect is:

```
() => { document.title = name; }
```

In our effect, we assign the value of the name variable to the document.title. 

## Clean Up Effects

When we add event listeners to the DOM, it is important to remove those event listeners when we are done with them to avoid memory leaks!

Let’s consider the following effect:

```
useEffect(()=>{
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  };
})
```

Because effects run after every render and not just once, React calls our cleanup function before each re-render and before unmounting to clean up each effect call.

If our effect returns a function, then the useEffect() Hook always treats that as a cleanup function. React will call this cleanup function before the component re-renders or unmounts. Since this cleanup function is optional, it is our responsibility to return a cleanup function from our effect when our effect code could create memory leaks.
If our effect didn’t return a cleanup function, then a new event listener would be added to the DOM’s document object every time that our component re-renders. Not only would this cause bugs, but it could cause our application performance to diminish and maybe even crash!

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState(0);

  // your code here
  const increment = () => setClickCount((prev) => {prev + 1})

  useEffect(() => {
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', increment)
    return () => document.removeEventListener('mousedown', increment)
  })

  return (
      <h1>Document Clicks: {clickCount}</h1>
  );
}
```

## Control When Effects Are Called

It is common, when defining function components, to run an effect only when the component mounts (renders the first time), but not when the component re-renders. The Effect Hook makes this very easy for us to do! If we want to only call our effect after the first render, we pass an empty array to useEffect() as the second argument. This second argument is called the dependency array.

The dependency array is used to tell the useEffect() method when to call our effect and when to skip it. Our effect is always called after the first render but only called again if something in our dependency array has changed values between renders.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  
  const handleChange = ({target}) => {
    setName(target.value)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime((prev) => prev + 1)
    },1000)

    return () => {clearInterval(intervalId)}
  }, [])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Time: {time}</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
    </>
  );
}

```
```
useEffect(() => {
  alert("component rendered for the first time");
  return () => {
    alert("component is being removed from the DOM");
  };
}, []); 
```

Without passing an empty array as the second argument to the useEffect() above, those alerts would be displayed before and after every render of our component, which is clearly not when those messages are meant to be displayed. Simply, passing [] to the useEffect() function is enough to configure when the effect and cleanup functions are called!
