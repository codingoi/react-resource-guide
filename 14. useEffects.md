## Function Component Effects

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
 
function PageTitle() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
 
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Hi, ${name}`;
  });
 
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Use the input field below to rename this page!</p>
      <input onChange={({target}) => setName(target.value)} value={name} type='text' />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The first argument passed to the useEffect() function is the callback function that we want React to call after each time this component renders. We will refer to this callback function as our effect.

In our example, the effect is:

```
() => { document.title = name; }
```

In our effect, we assign the value of the name variable to the document.title. 

## Clean Up Effects

When we add event listeners to the DOM, it is important to remove those event listeners when we are done with them to avoid memory leaks!

Let’s consider the following effect:

```
useEffect(()=>{
  document.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  return () => {
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyPress);
  };
})
```

Because effects run after every render and not just once, React calls our cleanup function before each re-render and before unmounting to clean up each effect call.

If our effect returns a function, then the useEffect() Hook always treats that as a cleanup function. React will call this cleanup function before the component re-renders or unmounts. Since this cleanup function is optional, it is our responsibility to return a cleanup function from our effect when our effect code could create memory leaks.
If our effect didn’t return a cleanup function, then a new event listener would be added to the DOM’s document object every time that our component re-renders. Not only would this cause bugs, but it could cause our application performance to diminish and maybe even crash!

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [clickCount, setClickCount] = useState(0);

  // your code here
  const increment = () => setClickCount((prev) => {prev + 1})

  useEffect(() => {
    document.addEventListener('mousedown', increment)
    return () => document.removeEventListener('mousedown', increment)
  })

  return (
      <h1>Document Clicks: {clickCount}</h1>
  );
}
```

## Control When Effects Are Called

It is common, when defining function components, to run an effect only when the component mounts (renders the first time), but not when the component re-renders. The Effect Hook makes this very easy for us to do! If we want to only call our effect after the first render, we pass an empty array to useEffect() as the second argument. This second argument is called the dependency array.

The dependency array is used to tell the useEffect() method when to call our effect and when to skip it. Our effect is always called after the first render but only called again if something in our dependency array has changed values between renders.

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function Timer() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  
  const handleChange = ({target}) => {
    setName(target.value)
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setTime((prev) => prev + 1)
    },1000)

    return () => {clearInterval(intervalId)}
  }, [])

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Time: {time}</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
    </>
  );
}

```
```
useEffect(() => {
  alert("component rendered for the first time");
  return () => {
    alert("component is being removed from the DOM");
  };
}, []); 
```

Without passing an empty array as the second argument to the useEffect() above, those alerts would be displayed before and after every render of our component, which is clearly not when those messages are meant to be displayed. Simply, passing [] to the useEffect() function is enough to configure when the effect and cleanup functions are called!

## Fetch Data

Unnecessary round trips back and forth between our React components and the server can be costly in terms of:

- Processing
- Performance
- Data usage for mobile users
- API service fees

When the data that our components need to render doesn’t change, we can pass an empty dependency array, so that the data is fetched after the first render. When the response is received from the server, we can use a state setter from the State Hook to store the data from the server’s response in our local component state for future renders. Using the State Hook and the Effect Hook together in this way is a powerful pattern that saves our components from unnecessarily fetching new data after every render!

An empty dependency array signals to the Effect Hook that our effect never needs to be re-run, that it doesn’t depend on anything. Specifying zero dependencies means that the result of running that effect won’t change and calling our effect once is enough.

A dependency array that is not empty signals to the Effect Hook that it can skip calling our effect after re-renders unless the value of one of the variables in our dependency array has changed. If the value of a dependency has changed, then the Effect Hook will call our effect again!

```
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if the value stored by count changes
```

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { get } from './mockBackend/fetch';

export default function Forecast() {
  const [data, setData] = useState();
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState({});
  const [forecastType, setForecastType] = useState('/daily');

  useEffect(() => {
    alert('Requested data from server...');
    get(forecastType).then((response) => {
      setData(response.data)
    });
  }, [forecastType]);

  const handleChange = (index) => ({ target }) =>
    setNotes((prev) => ({
      ...prev,
      [index]: target.value
    }));

    if(!data) {
      return <p>Loading...</p>
    }

  return (
    <div className='App'>
      <h1>My Weather Planner</h1>
      <div>
        <button onClick={() => setForecastType('/daily')}>5-day</button>
        <button onClick={() => setForecastType('/hourly')}>Today</button>
      </div>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Summary</th>
            <th>Avg Temp</th>
            <th>Precip</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {data.map((item, i) => (
            <tr key={item.id}>
              <td>{item.summary}</td>
              <td> {item.temp.avg}°F</td>
              <td>{item.precip}%</td>
              <td>
                <input
                  value={notes[item.id] || ''}
                  onChange={handleChange(item.id)}
                />
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```
