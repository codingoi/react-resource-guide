## Create Container Component

Separating container components from presentational components is a popular React programming pattern.

If a component has to have state, make calculations based on props, or manage any other complex logic, then that component shouldn’t also have to render HTML-like JSX.

The functional part of a component (state, calculations, etc.) can be separated into a container component.

## Separate Presentational Component

The presentational component’s only job is to contain HTML-like JSX. It should be an exported component and will not render itself because a presentational component will always get rendered by a container component.

As a separate example, say we have Presentational and Container components. Presentational.js must export the component class (or function, when applicable):

export class Presentational extends Component {
Container.js must import that component:

import { Presentational } from 'Presentational.js';

##  Render Presentational Component in Container Component

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { GuineaPigs } from '../components/GuineaPigs';

const GUINEAPATHS = [
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-1.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-2.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-3.jpg',
  'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-guineapig-4.jpg'
];

class GuineaPigsContainer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.state = { currentGP: 0 };

    this.interval = null;

    this.nextGP = this.nextGP.bind(this);
  }

  nextGP() {
    let current = this.state.currentGP;
    let next = ++current % GUINEAPATHS.length;
    this.setState({ currentGP: next });
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.nextGP, 5000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

 render() { 
  const src = GUINEAPATHS[this.state.currentGP]; 
  return <GuineaPigs src={src} />;
}
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <GuineaPigsContainer />, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```


## Remove Logic from Presentational Component

The last step to separating the container component from the presentational component is to remove redundant logic in the presentational component. The presentational component should be left with the render function that contains JSX statements.

```
import React from 'react';

export class GuineaPigs extends React.Component {

  render() {
    let src = this.props.src;
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Guinea Pigs</h1>
        <img src={src} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
