## class vs className

Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. Probably the most frequent of these involves the word class.

In HTML, it’s common to use class as an attribute name:

```
<h1 class="big">Hey</h1>
```

In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead:

```
<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
```
This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

When JSX is rendered, JSX className attributes are automatically rendered as class attributes.


## Self-Closing Tags
Another JSX ‘gotcha’ involves self-closing tags.

What’s a self-closing tag?

Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag (div), and a closing tag (/div). However, some HTML elements such as img and input use only one tag. The tag that belongs to a single-tag element isn’t an opening tag nor a closing tag; it’s a self-closing tag.

When you write a self-closing tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket:

Fine in HTML with a slash:
 
```  
<br /> 
```
 
Also fine, without the slash:
 
```  
<br>

```
But!

In JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

Fine in JSX:
 
``` 
  <br />
```
 
NOT FINE AT ALL in JSX:

```
  <br>
```

## JavaScript In Your JSX In Your JavaScript
So far, we’ve focused on writing JSX expressions. It’s similar to writing bits of HTML, but inside of a JavaScript file.

In this lesson, we’re going to add something new: regular JavaScript, written inside of a JSX expression, written inside of a JavaScript file.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>2 + 3</h1>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);

//Output: <h1>2+3</h1>
```

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers - it reads them as text, just like HTML.

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>{2+3}</h1>,
  document.getElementById('app'))

//Output: <h1>5</h1>
```

## Variables in JSX
When you inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in your file.

That means that you can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared on the outside.

```
// Declare a variable:
const name = 'Gerdo';
 
// Access your variable 
// from inside of a JSX expression:
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
```

 ## Variable Attributes in JSX
When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

Here’s an example of how that might work:


```
// Use a variable to set the `height` and `width` attributes:
 
const sideLength = "200px";
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength} />
); 
```

Object properties are also often used to set attributes:

```
const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5",
  owl: "http://bit.ly/1XGtkM3",
  owlCat: "http://bit.ly/1Upbczi"
}; 
 
const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);
 
const owl = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owl} 
    alt="Unimpressed Owl" />
);
 
const owlCat = (
  <img 
    src={pics.owlCat} 
    alt="Ghastly Abomination" />
);

ReactDOM.render(owlcat, document.getElementById('app'));
```

## Event Listeners in JSX
JSX elements can have event listeners, just like HTML elements can. Programming in React means constantly working with event listeners.

You create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute. Here’s an example:

```
<img onClick={myFunc} />
```
An event listener attribute’s name should be something like onClick or onMouseOver: the word on, plus the type of event that you’re listening for.

An event listener attribute’s value should be a function. The above example would only work if myFunc were a valid function that had been defined elsewhere:

```
function myFunc() {
  alert('Make myFunc the pFunc... omg that was horrible i am so sorry');
}
 
<img onClick={myFunc} />
```

Note that in HTML, event listener names are written in all lowercase, such as onclick or onmouseover. In JSX, event listener names are written in camelCase, such as onClick or onMouseOver.

## JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Don't Work
Great work! You’ve learned how to use curly braces to inject JavaScript into a JSX expression!

Here’s a rule that you need to know: you can not inject an if statement into a JSX expression.

This code will break:

```
(
  <h1>
    {
      if (purchase.complete) {
        'Thank you for placing an order!'
      }
    }
  </h1>
)
```
The reason why has to do with the way that JSX is compiled. 


## JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Do Work - Part I

```
let message;

if (user.age >= drinkingAge) {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out this alcoholic beverage!
    </h1>
  );
} else {
  message = (
    <h1>
      Hey, check out these earrings I got at Claire's!
    </h1>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  message, 
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator

Recall how it works: you write 
x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. 
When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy.” 
If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. 
If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

function coinToss () {
  // Randomly return either 'heads' or 'tails'.
  return Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails';
}

const pics = {
  kitty: 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-kitty.jpg',
  doggy: 'https://content.codecademy.com/courses/React/react_photo-puppy.jpeg'
};

const img = <img src={pics[coinToss() === 'heads' ? 'kitty' : 'doggy']} />;

ReactDOM.render(
	img, 
	document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## JSX Conditionals: &&

&& works best in conditionals that will sometimes do an action, but other times do nothing at all.

Here’s an example:

```
const tasty = (
  <ul>
    <li>Applesauce</li>
    { !baby && <li>Pizza</li> }
    { age > 15 && <li>Brussels Sprouts</li> }
    { age > 20 && <li>Oysters</li> }
    { age > 25 && <li>Grappa</li> }
  </ul>
);
```
If the expression on the left of the && evaluates as true, then the JSX on the right of the && will be rendered. If the first expression is false, however, then the JSX to the right of the && will be ignored and not rendered.

## .map in JSX

If you want to create a list of JSX elements, then .map() is often your best bet. It can look odd at first:

```
const strings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
 
const listItems = strings.map(string => <li>{string}</li>);
 
<ul>{listItems}</ul>
```


```
const people = ['Rowe', 'Prevost', 'Gare'];

const peopleLis = people.map(person =>
  return <li>{person}</li>
);

// ReactDOM.render goes here:
ReactDOM.render(<ul>{peopleLis}</ul>, document.getElementById('app'))
```

## Keys
When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called keys:

```
<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul>
```
A key is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s name is key. The attribute’s value should be something unique, similar to an id attribute.

keys don’t do anything that you can see! React uses them internally to keep track of lists. If you don’t use keys when you’re supposed to, React might accidentally scramble your list-items into the wrong order.

Not all lists need to have keys. A list needs keys if either of the following are true:

- The list-items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.

- A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.

If neither of these conditions are true, then you don’t have to worry about keys. If you aren’t sure then it never hurts to use them!

## React.createElement
You can write React code without using JSX at all!

The majority of React programmers do use JSX, and we will use it for the remainder of this tutorial, but you should understand that it is possible to write React code without it.

The following JSX expression:

```
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
can be rewritten without JSX, like this:

const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, world"
);
```
When a JSX element is compiled, the compiler transforms the JSX element into the method that you see above: React.createElement(). Every JSX element is secretly a call to React.createElement().
