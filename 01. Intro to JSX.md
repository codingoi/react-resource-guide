## Intro

```
const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
```

JSX is a **syntax extension** for JavaScript. It was written to be used with React.
JSX is not valid JavaScript. Web browsers can’t read it.

If a JavaScript file contains JSX code, then that file will have to be compiled. That means that before the file reaches a web browser, a JSX compiler will translate any JSX into regular JavaScript.

## JSX Element

A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element.

Here’s an example of a JSX element:

```
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```
This JSX element looks exactly like HTML! The only noticeable difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file, instead of in an HTML file.


## JSX Elements And Their Surroundings
JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.

That means that a JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array…you name it.

Here’s an example of a JSX element being saved in a variable:

```
const navBar = <nav>I am a nav bar</nav>;
```
Here’s an example of several JSX elements being stored in an object:

```
const myTeam = {
  center: <li>Benzo Walli</li>,
  powerForward: <li>Rasha Loa</li>,
  smallForward: <li>Tayshaun Dasmoto</li>,
  shootingGuard: <li>Colmar Cumberbatch</li>,
  pointGuard: <li>Femi Billon</li>
};
```


## Attributes In JSX
JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.

A JSX attribute is written using HTML-like syntax: a name, followed by an equals sign, followed by a value. The value should be wrapped in quotes, like this:

```
my-attribute-name="my-attribute-value"
```
Here are some JSX elements with attributes:

```
<a href='http://www.example.com'>Welcome to the Web</a>;
 
const title = <h1 id='title'>Introduction to React.js: Part I</h1>; 
```
A single JSX element can have many attributes, just like in HTML:

```
const panda = <img src='images/panda.jpg' alt='panda' width='500px' height='500px' />;
```


## Nested JSX
You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.

Here’s an example of a JSX h1 element, nested inside of a JSX a element:

```
<a href="https://www.example.com"><h1>Click me!</h1></a>
```
To make this more readable, you can use HTML-style line breaks and indentation:

```
<a href="https://www.example.com">
  <h1>
    Click me!
  </h1>
</a>
```
If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses.

```
(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)
```

Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions, etc., just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here’s an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:

```
 const theExample = (
   <a href="https://www.example.com">
     <h1>
       Click me!
     </h1>
   </a>
 );
 ```
 
 ## JSX Outer Elements
There’s a rule that we haven’t mentioned: a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.

In other words, this code will work:

```
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

But this code will not work:

```
const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p> 
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

***The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!***
