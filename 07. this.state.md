## Setting Initial State

A React component can access dynamic information in two ways: props and state.

Unlike props, a component’s state is not passed in from the outside. A component decides its own state.

To make a component have state, give the component a state property. This property should be declared inside of a constructor method, like this:

```
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mood: 'decent' };
  }
 
  render() {
    return <div></div>;
  }
}
 
<Example />
```

this.state should be equal to an object, like in the example above. This object represents the initial “state” of any component instance. We’ll explain that more soon!
constructor and super are both features of ES6, not unique to React. 
**It is important to note that React components always have to call super in their constructors to be set up properly.**

**Make sure not to separate constructor and render with a comma! Methods should never be comma-separated, if inside of a class body. This is to emphasize the fact that classes and object literals are different.**


## Access a Component's state

To read a component’s state, use the expression this.state.name-of-property:

```
class TodayImFeeling extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mood: 'decent' };
  }
 
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>
        I'm feeling {this.state.mood}!
      </h1>
    );
  }
}
```

Just like this.props, you can use this.state from any property defined inside of a component class’s body.


## Update state with this.setState

A component can do more than just read its own state. A component can also change its own state.

A component changes its state by calling the function this.setState().

this.setState() takes two arguments: an object that will update the component’s state, and a callback. You basically never need the callback.

In the code editor, take a look at Example.js. Notice that ```<Example />``` has a state of:

```
{
  mood:   'great',
  hungry: false
}
```
Now, let’s say that <Example /> were to call:

```this.setState({ hungry: true });```

After that call, here is what ```<Example />```‘s state would be:

```
{
  mood:   'great',
  hungry: true
}
```
The mood part of the state remains unaffected!

this.setState() takes an object, and merges that object with the component’s current state. If there are properties in the current state that aren’t part of that object, then those properties remain how they were.

## Call this.setState from Another Function

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class Mood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mood: 'good' };
    this.toggleMood = this.toggleMood.bind(this);
  }

  toggleMood() {
    const newMood = this.state.mood == 'good' ? 'bad' : 'good';
    this.setState({ mood: newMood });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I'm feeling {this.state.mood}!</h1>
        <button onClick={this.toggleMood}>
          Click Me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<Mood />, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Here is how a <Mood />‘s state would be set:

- A user triggers an event (in this case a click event, triggered by clicking on a <button></button>).
- The event from Step 1 is being listened for (in this case by the onClick attribute on line 20).
- When this listened-for event occurs, it calls an event handler function (in this case, this.toggleMood(), called on line 20 and defined on lines 11-14).
- Inside of the body of the event handler, this.setState() is called (in this case on line 13).
- The component’s state is changed!
- Due to the way that event handlers are bound in JavaScript, this.toggleMood() loses its this when it is used on line 20. Therefore, the expressions this.state.mood and this.setState on lines 12 and 13 won’t mean what they’re supposed to… unless you have already bound the correct this to this.toggleMood. That is why we must bind this.toggleMood to this on line 8.


## this.setState Automatically Calls render

 Any time that you call this.setState(), this.setState() AUTOMATICALLY calls .render() as soon as the state has changed.

Think of this.setState() as actually being two things: this.setState(), immediately followed by .render().

That is why you can’t call this.setState() from inside of the .render() method! this.setState() automatically calls .render(). If .render() calls this.setState(), then an infinite loop is created.
